Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, requested a transition of their existing Android based game, "Draw It or Lose It", to a web based platform. The goal was to develop a multiplatform experience that can run on different devices and operating systems. The sofware requirments included the use of design patterns like singleton for a single instance of the game and Iterator for navigating through teams and players.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

One aspect that went really well was outlining the key design patterns and technical requirments. It helped provide a clear blueprint for handling challenges of managing multiple gae instances, teams, and players while also ensuring the game remains efficient and scalable.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It allowed for a more structured approach to understanding the clients requirements and breaking down the technical components needed to achieve those requirements. This helped ensure that the development of the code was focused with the overall goals. The design document was a great reference point which helped me to ensure that all components of the game were accounted for.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would improve the security section. While I believe the general security measures were outlined, I would provide a more detailed analysis of risks, like potential vulnerabilities in mult platform environments and offer more robust solutions like encryption mehtods and more authentication protocols.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Interpreting the user's needs were a very important part of the design process. For example, the client wanted the game to support multiple instances, teams, and players with unique identifiers, which is where the decision to use design patterns like Singleton and Iterator came from. By focusing on these needs the design ensured that the game could scale effectively. It is crucial to cosider the users needs when designing software because of the application ultimatey depends on how well it meets those needs.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached desgning the software by breaking down the problem into manageable components and applying appropiate design patterns to solve specific issues. In the future, I would cotinue to use a systematic approach to analyze and design similar software applications. This would include conducting thorough requirement analysis, using proven design patterns, and ensuring scalability and security from the beginning.
